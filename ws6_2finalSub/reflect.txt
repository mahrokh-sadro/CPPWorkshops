Whenever we have classes with resources we need to follow the rule of 3. We have to have destructor, copy 
constructor and copy assignment. We either have to implement copy constructor and copy assignment  or prevent
 copying and assigning in a class by setting their prototypes to zero in header file.
Copy constructor is used to create a new object out of an existing one of the same, but assignment operator is used 
when copying data from an existing object to another existing object. How to extract n unknown number of characters
 from the standard input and display the characters on the standard output object:we need to use std::getline() helper function to read from standard input, to use this function we need a c++ srting and
 an instance of istream class. then we get the size of string using length() function and dynamically allocate proper
 size and create a C-style null-terminated string.

When it comes to files, an instance of ofstream creates , open and write to a file,while an instance of ifstream 
reads from a file. The main difference between an instance of istreams and getline() is that the delim of the former 
is space meaning it reads 1 word, but the delim of the latter is \n by default(you can change it ).
